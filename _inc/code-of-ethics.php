			<p><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> Adecoagro S.A., including its affiliates (the “Company”) is committed to the highest standards of legal and ethical business conduct.  This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”) summarizes the legal, ethical and regulatory standards that the Company must follow and is a reminder to our directors, officers and employees, of the seriousness of that commitment. Compliance with this Code and high standards of business conduct is mandatory for every Company employee.</p>
			
			<h4 class="h5 id-green">Introduction</h4>
			
			<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Our business is becoming increasingly complex, both in terms of the geographic areas in which we operate and the laws with which we must comply. To help our directors, officers and employees understand what is expected of them and to carry out their responsibilities, we have created this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Additionally, we have created a new position of Company Ethics Officer to oversee adherence to the Code.</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>This Code is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to all of our policies or to all your responsibilities under law or regulation. It provides general parameters to help you resolve the ethical and legal issues you encounter in conducting our business. Think of this Code as a guideline, or a minimum requirement, that must always be followed. The Company may introduce more restrictive policies or practices that must adhere to. If you have any questions about anything in the Code or appropriate actions in light of the Code, you may contact the Company Ethics Officer.</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>We expect each of our directors, officers and employees to read and become familiar with the ethical standards described in this Code and to affirm your agreement to adhere to these standards by signing the Compliance Certificate that appears at the end of this Code.  Violations of the law, our corporate policies, or this Code may lead to disciplinary action, including dismissal.</p>

<h4 class="h5 id-green">1) We Insist on Honest and Ethical Conduct By All of Our Directors, Officers, Employees and Other Representatives</h4>
			
			<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>We have built our business based on excellence in products and services: not only quality products and services but quality employees and representatives who adhere to the very highest standards of honesty, ethics and fairness in our dealings with all of our business contacts.  We place the highest value on the integrity of our directors, our officers and our employees and demand this level of integrity in all of our dealings. We insist not only on ethical dealings with others, but on the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships.</p>
            
            <h4 class="h5 id-green">Fair Dealing</h4>
			
			<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Directors, officers and employees are required to deal honestly and fairly with our customers, employees, collaborators, competitors and other third parties.  </p>

<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Although sales and costs are the lifeblood of any organization, we market our products and services fairly and vigorously based on our honesty, creativity and ingenuity and the proven quality and reliability of the products.  Effectively serving our investors and customers, is our most important goal — in the eyes of the customer you are the Company.  In our dealings with customers and suppliers, we:</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Prohibit bribes, kickbacks or any other form of improper payment, direct or indirect, to any representative of government, labor union, customer or supplier in order to obtain a contract, some other commercial benefit or government action;</p>
<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Prohibit our directors, officers and employees from accepting any bribe, kickback or improper payment from anyone.</p>
<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Prohibit gifts or favors of more than nominal value to or from our customers or suppliers without the prior authorization of compliance officer;</p>
<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Limit marketing and client entertainment expenditures to those that are necessary, prudent, job-related and consistent with our policies;</p>
<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Require clear and precise communication in our contracts, our advertising, our literature, and our other public statements and seek to eliminate misstatement of fact or misleading impressions;
<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Reflect accurately on all invoices to customers the sale price and terms of sales for products sold or services rendered;</p>
<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Protect all proprietary data our customers or suppliers provide to us as reflected in our agreements with them; and</p>
<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Prohibit our representatives from otherwise taking unfair advantage of our customers or suppliers, or other third parties, through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information or misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair-dealing practice.</p>

<h4 class="h5 id-green">Conflicts of Interest; Corporate Opportunities</h4>
			
			<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Our directors, officers and employees should not be involved in any activity that creates or gives the appearance of a conflict of interest between their personal interests and the interests of the Company. A “conflict of interest” occurs when a director’s, officer’s or employee’s personal interest interferes with the Company’s interest. In particular, without the specific permission of the Company’s Ethics Officer, no director, officer or employee shall:

<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Be a consultant to, or a director, officer or employee of, or otherwise operate an outside business that:  
<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Markets products or services in competition with our current or potential products and services.

<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Enters into a farm lease agreement or any similar transaction that might create or give an appearance of a conflict of interest; except for those transactions or investments made before becoming an employee of the Company or follow-on investments related to such transactions.

<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Enter into any transaction with the Company’s suppliers for the acquisition of goods and/or services to be used and/or rendered in properties or assets which are not the property of the Company

<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Supplies products or services to the Company;

<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Purchases products or services from the Company; or

ü  Has any financial interest, including significant stock ownership, in any entity with which we do business that might create or give the appearance of a conflict of interest;


Divert to himself or herself or to others any opportunities that are discovered through the use of the Company’s property or information or as a result of his or her position with the Company.
 Seek or accept any personal loan, or services from any entity with which we do business, except from financial institutions or service providers offering similar loans or services to third parties under similar terms in the ordinary course of their respective businesses;
Be a consultant to, or a director, officer or employee of, or otherwise operate an outside business if the demands of the outside business would interfere with the director’s, officer’s or employee’s responsibilities to us;
Accept any personal loan or guarantee of obligations from the Company, except to the extent such arrangements are legally permissible upon the prior written approval of the Company; or
Conduct business on behalf of the Company with family members.
In many cases a potential conflict of interest or violation of trust may be avoided by making a full disclosure of the facts to the Company prior to the completion of any transaction, thereby permitting the Company to make an informed, independent decision regarding the implication of any such transaction.

Directors, officers, and employees must notify the Ethics Officer, of any situation that could reasonably be expected to give rise to the existence of any actual or potential conflict of interest. </p>

 <h4 class="h5 id-green">Confidentiality and Corporate Assets</h4>

<h4 class="h5 id-green">REPORTING AND EFFECT OF VIOLATIONS</h4>
			
			<p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Compliance with the Code is, first and foremost, the individual responsibility of every director, officer and employee.  We attempt to foster a work environment in which ethical issues and concerns may be raised and discussed with supervisors or with others without the fear of retribution.  It is our responsibility to provide a system of reporting and access when you wish to report a suspected violation, or to seek counseling, when the normal chain of command cannot, for whatever reason, be used.

<h4 class="h5 id-green">Administration</h4>

The Board of Directors have established the standards of business conduct contained in this Code and oversee compliance with this Code.  They have also created empowered the Ethics Officer  to ensure adherence to the Code.

Training on this code will be included in the orientation of new employees and provided to existing directors, officers, and employees on an on-going basis.

<h4 class="h5 id-green">Reporting Violations and Questions</h4>

In the event that a holder of registered shares does not provide an address to which all notices or announcements from the Company may be sent, the Company may permit a notice to this effect to be entered into the regis­ter(s) of Shareholders and such holder's address will be deemed to be at the registered office of the Company or such other address as may be so entered by the Company from time to time, until a different address shall be provided to the Company by such holder.
